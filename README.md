This document outlines the design of an event-based system for receiving and processing noise telemetry from sensors. Our system is engineered to efficiently handle and validate incoming telemetry data, ensuring timely notification to clients regarding new data insights.

## 🌐 System Overview

The Noise Processing System is designed to leverage two types of communication channels to facilitate the real-time processing of noise data. The primary operations of this system include:

- **📥 Receiving Telemetry:** Securely capturing noise data transmitted by the sensors.
- **✔️ Data Validation:** Performing checks to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the incoming telemetry.
- **🔔 Client Notification:** Alerting clients to new data availability, enabling prompt action or analysis.

### 📊 Data Representation

The telemetry data consists of numerical values representing decibel levels recorded by each sensor. This approach allows for a standardized measurement of noise levels across different environments.

### ⏱ Sensor Data Transmission

Each sensor in the network is configured to send data at 30-second intervals. This frequency ensures a near real-time understanding of the noise environment, facilitating effective monitoring and analysis.
